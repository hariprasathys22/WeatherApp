With the advent of YouTube, Facebook, and Flickr, many savvy political
consultants undertook revolutionary micro-targeting and get-out-the-vote
techniques that enabled political candidates with _/cash-strapped
budgets to be able to reach numerous likely voters and succeed in
raising large numbers of money/_ from enthusiastic and committed
supporters in a short period of time.
/radio_button_unchecked

/radio_button_unchecked

/cash-strapped budgets to reach numerous likely voters and be successful
in raising large amounts of money

/radio_button_checked

/cash-strapped budgets to reach numerous likely voters, succeeding in
raising large amounts of money

/radio_button_unchecked

/cash-strapped budgets to reach numerous likely voters and succeed in
raising large amounts of money

/radio_button_unchecked

/cash-strapped budgets to be able to reach numerous likely voters and
succeed in raising large amounts of money

Correct Answer: cash-strapped budgets to reach numerous likely voters
and succeed in raising large amounts of money

Explain

1. The sentence must be constructed such that corresponding consequences
of an action are parallel. Specifically, the sentence should read
enabled political candidates with cash-strapped budgets to x and y where
x and y are parallel.
2. The phrase to be able to z is redundant and should be replaced by to z
3. The phrase numbers of money should be amounts of money since number
is only used when the object in question can be counted and money cannot
be counted (i.e., you do not say 1 money, 2 money, 3 money). Note: By
comparison, dollars can be counted (i.e., you would say 1 dollar, 2
dollars, 3 dollars) and as a result, we would say: the number of dollars.

a.the phrase to be able to reach is redundant and can be shortened as
follows: to reach; large numbers of money is not grammatically correct
since money itself cannot be counted and, as a result, amount should be
used instead

b.the phrase to reach…and be successful is not parallel

c.this sentence is set up such that succeeding modifies reaching voters
instead of being a separate action on its own

d.the phrase is parallel (i.e., to reach…[to] succeed); to be able to
reach is replaced by the shorter to reach

e.the phrase to be able to reach is redundant and should be replaced by
to reach

by itself’. The expected meaning is ‘Governed by itself’. The only
option which gives that meaning is option (D): *Autonomous.*

‘Auto’ means ‘self’ (Automobile – Self moving). ‘Nomos’ means ‘arran

Correct Answer:

2.7182818284590455

Explain

*Explanation:*

*For N=20*

and Three variables are initialized as s = 0, f = 1, i = 1


/while (i <= N):/

/f = f * i/

/s = s +(i / f)/

/i+=1/


  * * while(condition)* { statement(s) :block of statements; } The
    condition may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. The
    loop iterates while the condition is true.
  * The while loop evaluates the condition inside the parentheses ().
  * If condition is *true*, statements inside the body of while loop are
    executed. Then, condition is evaluated again.
  * The process goes on until condition is evaluated to *false*.
  * If condition is *false*, the loop terminates (ends).


Initially i=1, condition i<=20 is true so,

f= f*i => f=1, s=s+(i/f) => s=0+(1/1) => s=1

and i is incremented by 1, i=2


For i=2, condition is evaluated again i<=20 is true so,

f= f*i => f=1*2=> f=2,

s=s+(i/f) => s=1+(2/2) => s=2

and i is incremented by 1, i=3


For i=3, condition is evaluated again i<=20 is true so,

f= f*i => f=2*3=> f=6,

s=s+(i/f) => s=2+(3/6) => s=2+0.5 => s=2.5

and i is incremented by 1, i=4


For i=4, condition is evaluated again i<=20 is true so,

f= f*i => f=6*4=> f=24,

s=s+(i/f) => s=2+(4/24) => s=2+0.166.. => s=2.666..

and i is incremented by 1, i=5


The process goes on until condition is evaluated to *false* i.e when i>20

and the final value of s is 2.7182818284590455.

Here, if statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of
the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with
that if is executed, and If the condition is false the block statements
under IF is bypassed, then the final else statement will be executed. 

so let's check the first if condition /if(x is EQUAL TO 1) => /*/Is x is
EQUAL TO 1? => 2=0? =>False/*

and Final else statement will be executed, prints "C".

Correct Answer:

21

Explain

*Explanation:*

There are four variables f, g and n, sum declared. Value initialized for
f is 6, g is 9 and sum is 0 

if condition : if(g>f) => if( 9>6) is true

the statements under if condition will be executed

/ for (n = f; n < g; n = n + 1)/

/sum = sum + n /

For loop, n value starts from f, f=6 loop will run till the n<g, g=9,


  * *In the first iteration:* n value is 6, sum will be updated to
    sum=sum + n i.e sum=0 + 6 => sum = 6.


  * *2nd iteration:* n value will be incremented by 1, n=7. sum will be
    updated to sum=sum + n i.e sum=6 + 7 => sum = 13.


  * *3rd iteration:* n value will be incremented by 1, n=8. sum will be
    updated to sum=sum + n i.e sum=13 + 8 => sum = 21.


  * *4th iteration:* n value will be incremented by 1, n=9

Here for loop condition gets false, it comes out of the /for/ loop. The
output of Pseudocode sum is 21.

Explain

*Explanation:*

There are four variables i, j,k, and n declared. Value initialized for j
is 1 and k is 1.


For loop, i value starts from 1 loop will run till the i<5, In the first
iteration i value, is 1, printing k value is 1. Next line j value will
be incremented by 1 (1+1) =>2. On the next line adding k and j (1+2),
then the answer is 3.


2nd iteration i value will be incremented by 1, i=2. Print k, the
updated k value is 3. on the next line j value will be incremented by 1
(2+1) =>3. On the next line adding k and j (3+3) , then the answer is 6.


3rd iteration i value will be incremented by 1, i=3. Print k, the
updated k value is 6. on the next line j value will be incremented by 1
(3+1) =>4. On the next line adding k and j (6+4) , then the answer is 10.


4th iteration i value will be incremented by 1, i=4. Print k, the
updated k value is 10. on the next line j value will be incremented by 1
(4+1) =>5. On the next line adding k and j (10+5) , then the answer is 15.


5th iteration i value will be incremented by 1, i=5. Print k, the
updated k value is 15. Next line j value will be incremented by 1 (5+1)
=>6. On the next line adding k and j (15+6), then the answer is 21.


Here for loop condition gets false, it comes out of the for loop. The
output of Pseudocode is 1 3 6 10 15.

Correct Answer:

Explain

*Explanation:*

  * There are three variables pp, qq and rr declared. Value initialized
    for pp is 8, qq is 4 and rr is 5.
  * For loop, rr value starts from 4 loop will run till the rr<=5,

*=> In the first iteration: * *rr= 4*

Let’s check out the if condition =>  if((rr- pp +qq)<(qq +rr))

if( (4-8 + 4 ) < (4 + 4))

if(0<8) => true

so the statement under If block will be execute /pp=(5+5)+ qq/

/pp = 10 + 4 =>/*/pp = 14/*

// the value of pp is updated as**  pp=(rr+ qq)+pp => pp = (4 + 4 ) + 14
=> pp=22

rr value will be incremented by 1, rr=5.

*=> * *In the Second iteration: * *rr= 5*

Let’s check out the if condition =>  if((rr-pp +qq)<(qq +rr))

if( (5-14 + 4 ) < (4 + 5))

if(-5<9) => true

so the statement under If block will be execute /pp=(5+5)+ qq/

/pp = 10 + 4 => pp = 14/

the value of pp is updated as**  pp=(rr+ qq)+pp => pp = (5 + 4 ) + 14 =>
*pp=23*

rr value will be incremented by 1,*rr=6.*

*Loop terminates for rr=6*


  * Control goes to print statement and prints, pp+ qq => 23+ 4 => pp +

for( each c from 2 , less than 3)

{ b=c +b

if((a+9)<(9-a))

continue;

break;

b=10+a

}

For loop, c value starts from 2 and loop will run till the c<3, the loop
runs for 1 time;

*1st iteration : c=2*

b = c + b => b= 2+ 4 => b=6

if((a+9)<(9-a))=> if((8+9)<(9-8)) => if(17<1) *false*

and entered into else block where encountered break!! Out of loop

So the final answer is a +b = 8 + 6 =14


*Note: *

  * The *'break' *statement alters the normal flow of execution as it
    terminates the current loop and resumes execution of the statement
    following that loop.
  * When a *'continue'* statement is encountered, the control skips the
    execution of remaining statements inside the body of the loop for
    the current iteration and jumps to the beginning of the loop for the
    next iteration. If the loop’s condition is still true, the loop is
    entered again, else the control is transferred to the
    statement immediately following the loop.

Explain

*Explanation:*


For a=1 and b=2

/For loop will run from i = ZERO to SIX, each time INCREMENT by 2 )/

Our counter will increment by 2 each time the loop runs.


*1st iteration: i=0 *

a= a+ b+ i => a= 1+ 2+ 0 => a=3

a= a + b => a= 3 + 2=> *a=5*

b = a-b => b= 5-2 => *b=3*

*prints b // b=3*

Then i value will be incremented by 2(now i=2) condition gets true i<=6


*2nd iteration: i=2 *

a= a+ b+ i => a= 5+ 3+ 2 => a=10

a= a + b => a= 10 + 3=>*a=13*

b = a-b => b= 13-3 => *b=10*

*prints b // b=10*

Then i value will be incremented by 2(now i=4) condition gets true i<=6


*3rd iteration: i=4*

a= a+ b+ i => a= 13+ 10+ 4 => a=27

a= a + b => a= 27 + 10=> *a=37*

b = a-b => b= 37-10=> *b=27*

*prints b // b=27*

Then i value will be incremented by 2(now i=6) condition gets true i<=6


*4th iteration: i=6*

a= a+ b+ i => a= 37+ 27+ 6 => a=70

a= a + b => a= 70 + 27=> *a=97*

b = a-b => b= 97-27=> *b=70*

*prints b // b=70*

Then i value will be incremented by 2(now i=8) condition gets false(
i<=6) and loop terminates.

Correct Answer:

9

Explain

*Explanation:*

There are three variables i, j, and k declared. Value initialized for k
is 8, In this code, we are moving with nested for loop.


Here I value is 1, for loop will check the condition i<=1 condition gets
true. Now, moving with inner for loop j value will be 1 condition gets
true j<=1.so, it prints K+1. Then j value will be incremented by 1(2<+1)
inner for loop condition gets false.


On the next iteration, i value will be incremented by 1, here the
updated i value is 2 (2<=1) condition get false. So the answer is 9.


 


*E.g. code to explain this:*


int i, j, k;

  k = 8;

  for(i=1 ;i<=1;i++){ => i=1 True

    for(j=i;j<=1;j++){ => j=1 true

      cout<< k+1; => print k+1 => 8+1 =>9

*Odd even sum*

*Problem statement:*

Implement of following function:

Int odd Even sum(int num);

The function accepts a non-negative integer ‘num’ as its argument.
Implement the function to find the sum of all odd digits and sum of all
digits of ‘num’and return sum without value is greater

*Example:*

*Input:*

98631

*Output:*

14

*Explanation:*

•Sum of odd digits = 9+3+1+=13

•Sum of even digits =8+6=14

Since(13<14),thus output is 14

The custom input format for the above case:

98631

(The line represent ‘num’)

*Sample input*:

274695

*Sample output*

21

The custom input format for the above case:

274695

QUESTION 02

*Problem statement*

An Autobiographical Number is a number N such that the first digit of N
represents the count of how many zeroes are there in N, the second digit
represents the count of how many ones are there in N and so on.

You are given a function,* def FindAutoCount(n):*

The function accepts string "n" which is a number and checks whether the
number is an autobiographical number or not. If it is, an integer is
returned, i.e. the count of distinct numbers in 'n'. If not, it returns 0.


*Assumption:*

The input string will not be longer than 10 characters.

Input string will consist of numeric characters.


*Note:*

If string is None return 0.


*Input:*

1210

*Output:*

3

*Explanation:*

0th position in the input contains the number of 0 present in input,
i.e. 1, in 1st position the count of number of 1s in input i.e. 2, in
2nd position the count of 2s in input i.e. 1, and in 3rd position the
count of 3s i.e. 0, so the number is an autobiographical number.

Now unique numbers in the input are 0, 1, 2, so the count of unique
numbers is 3. So 3 is returned.





46

        valueCount[i]=valueCount[i]-(n[i]-'0');
